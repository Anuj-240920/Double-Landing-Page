# Double-Landing-Page

A Double Landing Page is a web design layout that offers users two distinct pathways or choices upon entering a website. It is commonly used to cater to different types of audiences or user goals. For example, one side of the page could lead to a "Business" section and the other to a "Personal" section, or it could offer two different products or services.

This layout is highly effective in providing clear navigation and user experience, allowing visitors to immediately filter themselves into the category that best fits their needs. The design typically features contrasting visuals or themes to differentiate the two sections, while maintaining a cohesive look across the entire page. The goal is to streamline the user journey and ensure they quickly find relevant information, boosting engagement and conversion rates.
